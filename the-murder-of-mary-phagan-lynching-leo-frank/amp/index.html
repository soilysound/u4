As a bag was placed over his head he asked only that his wedding ring be given to his wife. Watched on by Atlanta's great and good, he was then hung to death from the branch of a tree.</p><p>How this mild-mannered young Jewish businessman met his brutal end is one of America's most complex and intractable mysteries. The only uncontested fact is that a 13-year-old girl was murdered; everything else remains tainted by a shameful legacy of racism and a that clouds the case to this day.</p><p>The murder of young Mary, and the subsequent arrest, conviction and lynching of Frank would prove so controversial and divisive that it would prompt the formation of two organisations that could hardly be greater polar opposites - the second chapter of the KKK and the Jewish anti-defamation league. </p><p>Leo Frank's high-profile murder trial became a media circus and created further divides in an Atlanta already deeply fractured along racial, religious and ethnic grounds. For many in the Jewish community, the subsequent guilty verdict was seen as symbolic of the depth of anti-Semitism in the United States, on a par with the infamous Dreyfus affair in France.</p><p>Prominent Jewish organisations, businessmen and media tycoons rallied behind Frank's innocence and campaigned to overturn the guilty verdict. Numerous stories appeared in the press which sided with Frank and tried to cast the spotlight of blame on alternative, black, suspects.</p><p>Much of the press coverage in favour of Frank was shockingly racist by today's standards, but par for the course for 1914 America. In a society riven with prejudice, the sad murder of Mary Phagan thus became polarised between two camps of differing but equally extreme bias.</p><p>For those advocating Frank's innocence, he was the victim of the anti-semitic discrimination endemic in American society; in its police and judiciary. For this camp, the true culprit was obviously the animalistic black man, unable to control his urge to ravage an innocent white girl. </p><p>Those who believed Frank had murdered Mary painted his supporters as part of an insidious Jewish conspiracy to avoid justice, tapping into the wider and more sinister beliefs of the time that a Jewish cabal of industrialists and bankers was taking over America.</p><p>In this feverish atmosphere, stoked relentlessly by the tabloid press, the  facts of the case got lost amongst much myth and fantasy, suborned and perjured testimony and outright lies.</p><p>To try and understand the truth in this murky case, we must go back to one Saturday afternoon in 1913, when a young factory worker went to collect her wages and was never see alive again.</p><p>IN early 20th century America, before child labour laws had made it illegal, it was common for girls like 13-year-old Mary Phagan to take manual work in factories. before the safety net of social s ecurity, families like the Phagans oftend epending on the children working for their very survival.</p><p>Mary had worked at Atlanta's National Pencil Company factory since she was just 10 years old. Renowned in the neighbourhood for her cheerful demanour, she was a notably pretty and popular girl who the orevious christmas had played Sleeping Beauty in the local church play. </p><p>On the afternoon of Saturday, April 26th Mary dropped into her workplace to pick up her wages for the week, hoping to then attend that day's Confederate Memorial Day parade in the town centre. She would never make it to the parade, or ever be seen alive again.</p><p>The factory's manager was Leo Frank, a 29-year-old graduate of Cornell university whose wealthy uncle owned shares in the factory's parent company.  At about noon Mary made her way to his office to collect her money, an ecnoutner Frank recalled later when interviewed by the police. He would be the last person to admit to seeing the teenager alive.</p><p>Sometime in the early hours of the next morning, the factory's nightwatchman Newt Lee made an horrific discovery. In the basement of the building he found the battered and bloodied body of a young girl, so covered in dirt it was impossible to determine whether she was black or white.</p><p>It was young Mary Phagan, beaten, raped and strangled with a cord. Despite his terror that he may be blamed, as a black man, for the murder, Lee immediately fetched the local police.</p><p>Lee's worry was well founded. He was arrested and charged with the crime by police, the next day a white mob gathering outside of the station with the intent of lynching him. </p><p>Whilst extra-judicial lynching had declined since its heyday in the 1890s, it was still an alarmingly common practice in 1913, especially against black men. Even the suspicion that Lee was involved in the rape and murder of a young white girl would have had fatal consequences for him.</p><p>Luckily, newt Lee was saved from he mob, and later cleared of any involvement. Police set about interviewing  ex and current workers at the factory to try and find the real culprit. Several men known to have been seen with Phagan in the past, such the recently dismissed factor clerk John gantt, but all were eventually cleared.</p><p>On Monday 1st of May detectives  called around at the house of factor superintendent Leo Franks. Although not arrested at this time, detective were extremely suspicious of Frank. Frommthe tentatively timeline they had assembled of Mary phagans day, Frsnk eas the last person to admit to have seen her alive. But what really worried police was the factory bosses nervous demeanour.</p><p>Lalalalalala - was this strange reaction from Frsnk evidence of guilt or simply the reaction of a man with a noted nervous disposition notnused to talking the policeman?</p><p>By now, the tone in Atlanta was one of hysteria. Thousands of people had visited the funerl home to view the dead giels body. Demand the murder be found was coming from as high up as the go over and state legitasture. The Atlanta constitution newspaper even announced a then massive $1000 reward for the capture of the killer on its front page.</p><p> A coroners jury, accompanied by several Atlanta policeman had reexamined the factory and found blond hairs and blood in the Machine room next to franks office. Another young factory girl also testified that she had come to collect her wage shortly after Mary but Frsnk was no in his office. On the basis of this evidence, and his strange demeanour, Frank was arrested on suspicion of the murder.</p><p>Another man, the factory's black janitor Jim Conley, was also arrested after witnesses saw him washing 'red stains' out of a shirt in a faucet behind the factory. Whilst Conley gave numerous contradictory statements about the murder, he would later be used as the chief witness against Leo Frsnk at the trial.</p><p>The police now had several suspects and a lots of evidence. By far the most perplexing and confusing of his was two notes that were found near Mary's body. Ostensibly written by Mary herself, the bizarre, broken English,mthe notes were virtually incomrehsuble. </p><p>The first note read  "he said he wood love me land down play like the night witch did it but that long tall black negro did boy his slef." The other said, "mam that negro hire down here did this i went to make water and he push me down that hole a long tall negro black that hoo it wase long sleam tall negro i write while play with me." </p><p>One thing was clear - Mary Phagan had not written these notes herself. Not only did she write in good English, the basement her body was found in was pitch black. It was impossible in the circumstances for a dying girl to have written the messages, and that meant only one thing. The notes had been written by her killer, probably in an attempt to frame Nat the night watchmen.</p><p>As the police developed more evidence, Leo Frank became their prime suspect. Conley was now saying that Frank had killed Phagan and he had helped him dispose of the body. Both the coroners jury and the grand jury unanimously voted to indict Frank for the murder.</p><p>The trial began on July 28th 1913, with state attorney Hugh Dorsey leading the prosecution. Dorsey attempted to portray the defendant as a sexual predator and pervert,  producing a succession of young women from the pencil factory to testify that Frank had made improper advances on them. </p><p>Dorsey's ace card was Jim Conley. By now the janitors many different stories had become one damning account of how Leo Frank had murdered Mary Phagan after she rejected is sexual advanced and then ordered Conley to help him dump the body in the factory basement. The two notes, Conley told the court, were written by him but dictated by Frank.</p><p>Conley proved to be an unimpeachable witness for the prosecution, withstanding hours of defence cross-examination with a cool assuredness. Some observers felt Conley's testimony had been heavily rehearsed, almost as if he was reading from a script, but it was enough to convince the jury and Frank was unanimously convicted and on October 10th, the  judge sentenced Leo Frank to hang. </p><p>Crowds of Atlantans who had being gathering outside of the courtroom over the last five weeks cheered the verdict. The sensational and salacious coverage of the trial in the newspapers had stoked up strong feelings against Frank in the city, where resentment had already been growing against wealthy industrialists and factory owners who were  believed to be exploiting child labor to run their businesses.</p><p>The rest of America was more divided by the verdict. Whilst widely celebrated in the South, Frank's conviction was questioned in the North.  Led by the New York Times, editorials appeared decrying the trial as a farce and an example of the anti-Semitism of the South.</p><p>This narrative took grip, and a campaign group of Jewish civic and business groups set out to overturn the conviction, raising $250,000 to help prove Frank's innocence. Private detectives were sent into Atlanta to review the case and numerous appeals were lodged with both the Georgia and the US Supreme Court.</p><p>In Atlanta, Frank was widely reviled as a child murderer and rapist, and the high-profile campaign to free him created a great deal of resentments in the South. Tom Watson, editor of the Jeffersonian tabloid newspaper, responded with accusations of a Jewish conspiracy of industrialist and press barons using their power to help a child murderer escape justice. </p><p>Watson's coverage flirted with ugly anti-Semitic stereotypes, but proved to be extremely popular in Georgia and  served to further stoke up the feeling against Frank and the Jewish community in Atlanta. It was even cited as one of the inspirations for the reformation of the KKK in the area. </p><p>The increasingly hysterical tone of the coverage was about to spill out from the newspapers and onto the streets in shocking fashion. </p><p>After all of his appeals failed, Leo Franks supporters turned to state  Governor John Slaton. Slaton had personally reviewed the case and come to the conclusion Frank was innocent. In the face of fierce opposition, Slatton made the fateful decision to commute Leo Frank's deaths sentence to life imprisonment.</p><p>The men that came for Leo Frank as he sat on his bunk at Milledgeville prison were remarkably solemn and organised for a mob.  On the night of August 16, 1915, 25 prominent Atlantan citizens made the decision to use their Southern prerogative and dispense what they saw as the rightful verdict of the court themselves.</p><p>Armed with guns they raided the jail and drove Frank 150 miles to the site of an oak tree in Mary Phagan hometown of Marietta, where they lynched him from the tree. The last act of the mob, none of whom were every charged, was to return Frank's wedding ring to his wife in accordance with his last words.</p><p>Th Leo Frank case had brought out the worst in everyone.  Both sides indulged in racism and anti-Semitism to prove their case and sensationalist newspaper coverage only further stoked up the often frenzied public mood.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a growing feeling that Frank's case was a miscarriage of justice that spawned a shameful public murder. Whether prejudice played a part in his conviction is debatable, Frank was found unanimously guilty by three separate juries, some of whom were Jewish. </p><p>However, some of the evidence that they used to declare Frank's guilt looks decidedly suspect. The crucial role of the janitor Jim Conley has come under particular scrutiny - the bloody shirt, his lies to the police, his admission that he wrote the so-called murder notes, and his rehearsed testimony at the trial make Conley stand out as the likely real murderer for many advocated of Franks innocence</p><p>The unsettling case of Leo Frank had largely been forgotten by the 1982, an unedifying episode that was best left to fade away into obscurity. That was until 83-year-old Alonzo Mann came forward with a bombshell - as the pencil factory office boy in 1913 he had seen Jim Conley moving Mary Phagan's corpse by himself.</p><p>Did this testimony settle this most divisive of cases?
