That case was the murder of Julia Wallace, the locked room mystery by which he judged all others.</p><p>Other great literary purveyors of murder, like PD James and Dorothy L Sayers, were equally baffled by the strange 1931 death of the Liverpool housewife.  But for all the mystery surrounding the circumstances of the crime, it is perhaps chief suspect William Herbert Wallace that remains the biggest conundrum of all.</p><p>The 52-year-old insurance salesman seemed strangely agitated as he rode the tram to his mysterious destination that dark winter evening in January 1931. Wallace was looking for an address he had never heard of before and, whether deliberately or not, his behaviour was ensuring he would be remembered.</p><amp-img src="http://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/wallace-portrait.jpg?-i3" width="300" height="200" layout="responsive" alt="William Herbert Wallace the unknowable insurance salesman" class="article__image"></amp-img><p>The tram's conductor recalled how Wallace repeatedly pestered him and his ticket inspector to alert him where to get off. When he eventually pointed Wallace to the correct stop, he seemed particularly keen to impart to the conductor - "I am a complete stranger around here".</p><p>On alighting, Wallace struggled to find the house he was seeking. Did 25 Menlove Gardens East even exist? Was he on a wild goose chase? If the suspicion had entered Wallace's thoughts, he had good reason considering the strange way the appointment had been made.</p><p>A local cafe where Wallace attended a chess club had received a message by phone for him the previous night, the caller giving his name as R. M. Qualtrough. Although Wallace only attended the chess club sporadically, the caller appeared to know he would be there that night and left a message for him with chess club captain Samuel Beattie, asking to meet regarding insurance business. </p><p>Wallace had never heard of Qualtrough and had never received an unsolicited call like this at his chess club before. But 1931 was  straitened times for depression-era Britain and he elected to keep the appointment scenting there may be some valuable commission in it for him. The message directed Wallace to meet Qualtrough at 25 Menlove Gardens East the following night at 7:30pm</p><p>And here he was, lost in the Liverpool night trying to find an address that seemed to be eluding him. He had left his home at about 6:30pm that evening, to meet the mysterious Mr. Qualtrough at 7.30pm, but was in danger of missing the appointment as he simply could not find the address the caller had given. </p><amp-img src="http://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/3581-bank-cottle-cafe.jpg" width="300" height="200" layout="responsive" alt="The call was received at the cafe were Wallace sometimes played chess" class="article__image"></amp-img><p>He had asked the tram conductors, he had stopped people in the street, he had consulted street directories in newsagents, he even stopped a policeman and recounted to him the whole strange saga. All the time ensuring everybody knew exactly when the appointment he was trying to keep was.</p><p>Was this a cunning murderer attempt to lay himself a watertight alibi, as some believe, or a flustered insurance salesman failing to make an appointment on time? </p><p>It turns out there are lots of Menlove Gardens in Liverpool - North, South, and West. East, however, remains conspicuous by its absence, a fact that was no doubt the subject of local jokes. Whoever had made that call appeared to be pulling Wallace's leg, sending him on a fruitless search for a nonexistent address.</p><p>Was this merely a strange prank or something more sinister? As the 7:30pm appointment evaporated into the night, and with no sign of his destination, Wallace eventually gave up and decided to return home.</p><p>It was around 8:45pm when John and Florence Johnston, Wallace's next door neighbours, saw him outside of his house at 29 Wolverton Street. He was looking perturbed as he explained to them that he could not get into, both the front and back-door were locked and he could not see any light within.</p><amp-img src="http://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/backyard.jpg?-i2" width="300" height="400" layout="responsive" alt="The backdoor where Wallace's neighbours observed him struggling with the lock" class="article__image"></amp-img><p>As the neighbours watched on, Wallace tried the back door lock one more time. Oddly, this time it worked and Wallace entered the house. As the Johnstons waited outside, Wallace lit a lamp and moved carefully around the house. A few moments later he stepped back outside and said flatly - "Oh come and seen, she's been killed".</p><p>To the Johnston's horror, Julia Wallace was laid out on the rug in front of the gas fire in the front room, violently battered to death, blood splatter splashed across the walls. "They've finished her, look at her brains", a ghostly pale Wallace muttered. There has been much speculation about Wallace's use of the word 'they' here. Was this the heat of the moment reaction of a shattered man or an unwitting slip letting on he knew more than one culprit was involved?</p><p>Back in the kitchen, Wallace noticed the locked cupboard where he kept his insurance collection money had been wrenched open and the four pounds inside had been stolen. Was this a robbery that had turned to murder? If so it looked a targeted one, the house had not been ransacked and nothing else had been taken, including the money from Julia's handbag which rested on the kitchen table.</p><p>At this point John Johnston took charge, ordering his wife and Wallace to stay in the house and touch nothing whilst he fetched the police and a doctor, the latter clearly a futile gesture considering the grisly state of Julia's body in the room next door.</p><p>Twenty-five minutes later the first of a cavalcade of officers from the Merseyside Police arrived at the Wallace home. It's fair to say their handling of the case over the next few days left much to be desired; the force had been seriously weakened by a major strike in 1919 that had led half of its staff to be dismissed, those remaining often filling in roles they were not properly qualified or experienced for. </p><amp-img src="http://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/julia-wallace-crime-scene.jpg?-i3" width="300" height="200" layout="responsive" alt="Police photograph of Julia Wallace's battered corpse. But who was the culprit?" class="article__image"></amp-img><p>The first officers on the scene, PC Fred Williams and Police Sergeant Breslin, made a cursory search of the property. It looked like someone had briefly rifled around in the bedroom, but the rest of the house appeared undisturbed. The officers made one important observation - underneath Julia's body was a partially burnt Macintosh coat. Had this belonged to the killer or was Julia wearing it when she was attacked?</p><p>During the next hour, a pressman from the Liverpool Daily Post arrived to do double duty as the police photographer, and John Edward Whitly MacFall, a lecturer of Forensic Medicine at Liverpool University called to act as the police's forensics expert. MacFall's role would prove to be the most contentious, with many commentators feeling he bungled the chance to gather the most vital piece of evidence - the time of death.</p><p>Even in 1931, using cadaveric rigor mortis alone to determine how long someone had been dead was out of date. But that's exactly what MacFall did, stating his opinion that Julia had died at about 8pm, 45 minutes before Wallace returned home, based purely on the body's stiffness. MacFall would later change his mind on the time of death, despite no other tests been conducted. </p><p>A more detailed examination of the body revealed that Julia had been beaten severely about the head with a blunt object, the most severe blows occurring around the left ear were brain tissue could be seen protruding from the skull. The fatal blows were probably inflicted whilst as she lay face down on the floor in front of the fire. Police believed she must have brushed the fire as she fell due to the singeing of her dress and the partial burning of the Macintosh coat.</p><p>Detective Superintendent Hubert Rory Moore arrived next and became exercised with the possibility that the crime was the work of the Anfield Housebreaker, a burglar that had plagued the local area in the previous months. Had one of his robberies resulted in fatal consequences for Julia Wallace?</p><amp-img src="http://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/wolverton-street-1931.jpg" width="300" height="200" layout="responsive" alt="The Wallace's house on Wolveton Street in Anfield, Liverpool" class="article__image"></amp-img><p>Whoever the culprit, so frenzied was the attack that it was obvious they must have been covered in blood. Splatter had sprayed around the whole room, blood drizzling the walls seven feet high. An examination of the house's drains and sinks revealed they had not been used that evening, so the assailant must have fled the property drenched in his victims blood.</p><p>A more thorough search of the house, yard and surrounding area could uncover no trace of a murder weapon. The Wallace's cleaner would tell police a thin metal fire poker and an iron bar from the parlor were missing. Was one of these the murder weapon?</p><p>Meanwhile, a subdued Wallace sat in his kitchen and calmly explained to Hubert Moore and the other detectives the strange circumstances of his evening, how he had been lured on a wild goosechase around Menlove Gardens by the chess club phone call from R. M Qualtrough. Around midnight he was taken to the police station to make a formal statement, stating - "I have no suspicion of anyone".</p><p>In the following days, police began to develop some contradictory evidence regarding Wallace's involvement in his wife's death. A switchboard supervisor at the Liverpool telephone exchange had narrowed the call to the chess club to a phone booth just 400 yards from Wallace's house in Wolverton Street. </p><amp-img src="http://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/anfield-1627.jpg" width="300" height="200" layout="responsive" alt="The enigmatic R. M. Qualtrough phoned from a telephone box near to Wallace's house" class="article__image"></amp-img><p>Tellingly, this booth was adjacent to where Wallace had caught the tram to his chess club the night before the murder. And it was shortly before he had arrived at the chess club that the telephone message had been received. To police, this looked like too much of a coincidence; had Wallace placed the call himself in order to provide himself with an alibi for the murder?</p><p>They had also noted Wallace's strange demeanor, especially how he had made such a fuss on the tram and around Menlove Gardens, and the number of people had had stopped and asked for directions.</p><p>They also interviewed the Johnstons and discovered the curious business with the locks shortly before the body had been discovered, and how they had magically opened once they were present. Was Wallace ensuring that he would not be alone when the body was discovered?</p><p>Despite these suspicions, the reconstruction of the times surrounding the murder looked a lot more positive for Wallace. He was firmly placed on the tram to Menlove Gardens at 7:06pm, and several witnesses had come forward to state they had seen Julia alive between 6:30 and 6:45pm. This would only have given Wallace a window of around fifteen minutes to kill his wife, clean himself up, change his clothes and go catch his tram.</p><p>It looked extremely unlikely Wallace could have done it in time. Police did try to increase the window of opportunity he might have had by staging a reenactment with a young officer sprinting from Wolverton Street to the tram stop, but it was obvious the ailing 52-year old insurance salesman was not capable of such a feat.</p><p>Whoever Qualtrough was, and whatever the purpose of the call, it had succeeded in providing Wallace with an almost cast iron alibi. The problem was, it didn't look like anyone else could have committed the crime either. No weapon, no suspects, no witnesses and the body found in a locked house; whoever had killed Julia appeared to have pulled off the perfect crime.</p><amp-img src="http://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/dorothy-sayers-newspaper.jpg" width="300" height="200" layout="responsive" alt="Renowned mystery novelist Dorothy L. Sayers because fixated on the Wallace case" class="article__image"></amp-img><p>It's no wonder the great mystery writers were so enamoured with the case, it would have made a classic story by the likes of Agatha Christie or Dorothy L. Sayers. The aforementioned Raymond Chandler said of it - "The Wallace case is the nonpareil of all murder mysteries ... I call it the impossible murder because Wallace couldn’t have done it, and neither could anyone else."</p><p>Despite the paucity of solid evidence in the case, the police charged Wallace with the murder. At his short, four-day trial in April 1931, the prosecution tried to argue that Wallace had committed the murder naked save for the Macintosh found beneath Julia's body, a salacious theory that made a particular impression in the court-room. The defense countered with the timings that seemed to be exculpatory for Wallace.</p><p>Wallace himself cut a lonely, impassive figure throughout, rarely showing any emotion. When called to the stand he spoke nervously but calmy, refusing to become flustered by the often aggressive questioning of the prosecution. </p><p>Some thought Wallace's demeanor was what sealed his fate with the jury, rather than the evidence. Despite a feeling by most observers in the courtroom that the prosecution had failed to make their case, and despite the Judge summing up favourably towards the defense, the jurors returned in just a few hours with a unanimous verdict - "Guilty".</p><blockquote>I am not guilty. I cannot say anything else.</blockquote><p>"You, William Herbert Wallace, have been convicted of murder upon the verdict of the jury.", the court clerk announced. "Have you anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon you according to law?" Wallace simply replied - "I am not guilty. I cannot say anything else".</p><p>Judge Robert Alderson Wright donned the customary black cap, perhaps somewhat reluctantly, and sentenced Wallace to the mandatory sentence of death by hanging.  There was little waiting on ceremony in 1930s England, and the provision executing date, barring appeals, was penned in for just a months time in May 1931. That appeal, however, saved Wallace's life.</p><amp-img src="http://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/murder-case-appeal.jpg" width="300" height="200" layout="responsive" alt="The press report on Wallace's appeal" class="article__image"></amp-img><p>The following month at the Court of Criminal Appeal in London, Justice Gordon Hewart overturned the guilty verdict. The case against Wallace was not - "proved with that certainty which is necessary in order to justify a verdict of guilty", he said. "The result is that this appeal will be allowed and this conviction quashed". Wallace walked out of the courtroom a free man.</p><p>The press, of course, delighted in the whole thing. Lurid headlines surrounded the case from beginning to end. Wallace was painted as an occultist, a philander and most of all an intellectual, chess playing mastermind - "The chess player they couldn't checkmate", as one newspaper put it. </p><p>Straight from the pages of fiction, Wallace had impeccably plotted a fiendish murder that both outwitted the police and generations of armchair mystery solvers. But if Wallace really was a criminal genius, he did not have long to savour his victory.</p><blockquote>The Wallace murder had no key-move and ended, in fact, in stalemate</blockquote><p>Seemingly diminished by the ordeal of his wife's death, the trial and the accusations in the press, Wallace moved away to a quiet bungalow in the Wirral. Suffering a recurrence of his old kidney troubles, he fell ill at Christmas 1932 and died in February 1933. If the mild-manner insurance salesman had any dark secrets he had taken them to his grave. </p><p>Since Wallace's death, the case has become one of the most debated in criminal history. Dozens of books have been written advocating various theories, some centered on Wallace's guilt, others on his innocence. But the case remains stubbornly unsolved, as Dorothy L. Sayers put it - "The Wallace murder had no key-move and ended, in fact, in stalemate."</p><p>Did William Herbert Wallace pull off the perfect crime and get away with murdering his wife?</p><h4>Evidence For</h4><h5>Conspicuous behaviour/alibi/demeanour</h5><p>Central to the case against Wallace is his odd behaviour on the evening of the murder. Normally not the most garrulous of men, during his hour or so sojourn to the nonexistent address in Menlove Gardens, Wallace stopped and discussed his prospective meeting with no less than a dozen strangers.</p><p>Wallace says he left his house at Wolverton Street at 6:45pm and caught the number 5 tram at 7:06pm. Both the conducter Thomas Charles Phillips and ticket inspector Edward Angus recalled how a visibly anxious Wallace repeatedly engaged them in conversation about exactly what route he should take in order to make his appointment at Menlove Gardens.</p><amp-img src="http://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/anfield-tram.jpg" width="300" height="200" layout="responsive" alt="Wallace was acting conspiciously on the tram" class="article__image"></amp-img><p>As an insurance salesman and collections agent, it was Wallace's job to travel around Liverpool and he knew the city well. He would often make hundreds of collections in  given week, either by foot or by travelling on the tram and bus network. If he didn;t already know where his destination was, its hard to understand why a methodical man like Wallace would not have consulted a map or street directory earlier in the day.</p><p>Yet here he was, </p><h5>brutality of murder - crime of passion, if not Wallace how come no signs of struggle, doors locked?</h5><h5>hired someone - Perry or marsden</h5><h5>pd James coincidence theory/joke</h5><h4>Evidence Against</h4><h5>Timing problems - defense upheld</h5><h5>Wallace not capable, not a genius or fiendish, marraige seemed to be happy - no motive, why not poison?</h5><h5>parry insurance robbery turned murder</h5><h5>Johnson had a key, did they do murder</h5><p>
